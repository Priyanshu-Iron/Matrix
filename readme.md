# MATRIX Wallpaper App

MATRIX is a dynamic wallpaper application inspired by the iconic green code rain from the Matrix series. This app provides users with a collection of stunning wallpapers, bringing the aesthetic of the Matrix right to their devices.

## üöÄ Showcasing My Matrix Wallpaper Website! üåå

After spending countless hours coding and refining, I‚Äôm excited to share the Matrix wallpaper website I built, where users can explore a unique collection of Matrix-inspired wallpapers and customize their own virtual space! This project allowed me to dive deep into both backend development and deployment.

## üîß Tech Stack:

- **Backend**: Built with Express.js to handle requests and routing efficiently.
- **Templating Engine**: Integrated EJS for dynamic page rendering and smooth user experience.
- **Frontend**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive design and easy customization.
- **Authentication**: Added Passport.js for secure user authentication, allowing users to save their preferences.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side interactivity, enhancing user engagement.

## üåê Deployment:

Successfully deployed the site on Vercel, allowing seamless and scalable hosting with minimal setup.

## üí° Key Learnings:

- Gained hands-on experience in backend development with Express.js and Passport.js for authentication.
- Enhanced my deployment skills, particularly on Vercel, making the process smoother and more efficient for future projects.
- Refined my approach to using Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and responsive design.
